# Linear_search
A little project I was working on.Not anything special but it's my first code.Hope to gain your support as I'll be adding more in the future 

#A description on how linear_search works.
Right now it only supports numbers but you can put as many numbers as you want.
It goes through the list sequentially so it's not a must that the list would be sorted as the algorithm would go through it sequentially and return the position 


#A description of how binary_search works.
It's a quicker way of obtaining the position of the number. Unlike linear_search the list needs to be sorted as binary_search doesn't go through it sequentially rather it goes to the midpoint of the list and if the target is larger than the midpoint it cancels out the other half that were smaller than the midpoint so if the list isn't arranged,it may end up going through the list without finding the number
