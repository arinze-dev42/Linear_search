# Linear_search
A little project I was working on.Not anything special but it's my first code.Hope to gain your support as I'll be adding more in the future 

#A description on how it works.
Right now it only supports numbers but you can put as many numbers as you want.

#Example
list of numbers = [12,23,31,14,78,32]

result = linear_search(list of numbers, 32)
verify(result)

output = 5
